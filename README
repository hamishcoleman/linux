This Repository
===============

This Linux Kernel Repository is used to build a working mainline kernel
for the Orange Pi Zero Single Board Computer, and several other Allwinner
SoCs, as well as working with the qemu arm 'virt' machine.

Branches exist for to track each of the original patches that were merged
to make this tree - these branches may rebase at any time as many of them
are not tracking actual git repositories.

The buildable and fully merged tree is in the "mvp" branch and this branch
will be re-created to remerge the patches for any new upstream kernel.

============

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
